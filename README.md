# InfoInspector
An Offline Android Information Finder based on the Provided Excel Files.

## Introduction

The project folder `InfoInspector` contains main app source files which depend on the project folder `android-support-v7-appcompat`.

When running the app, it will first create an empty folder in your SD card where you can put an Excel file as database later.

If there's no database file in the SD card, the app will automatically use its internal database file instead.

The project is easily constructed. Please feel free to use it.
