# InfoInspector
An Offline Android Information Finder based on Excel Files Provided.

## Introduction
The project folder `InfoInspector` contains main app source files which depend on the project folder `android-support-v7-appcompat`.<br>
When running the app, it will first create an empty folder in your SD card where you can put an Excel file as database later.<br>
If there's no database file in the SD card, the app will automatically use its internal database file instead.<br>
The project is easily constructed. Please feel free to use it.
